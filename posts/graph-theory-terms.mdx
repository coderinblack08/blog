  Graphs are a collection of points which are bounded by lines. We call the
  points of a graph, <strong>vertices</strong>, and the lines,{" "}
  <strong>edges</strong>.

A **complete graph** or **clique** is a graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Complete graphs are denoted by $K_n$ where $n$ is the total number of vertices. The total number of edges in a complete graph is $\binom{n}{2}$.

The opposite of a complete graph is a **null graph/independent set**. A null graph is a set of vertices with no edges between themselves.

A component or graph is **connected** if any pair of vertices are connected by a path (of multiple vertices). We are assuming the graph is undirected.

A graph is **planar** if it can be drawn in one plane with no intersecting edges. We can define faces of a planar graph. Notice the area outside the graph is also a face, called the unbounded face. For example, $K_4$ has $4$ faces.

Let's try to prove that $K_5$ is not planar. Four of the vertices can be formed into a square ($K_4$ is planar). The fifth vertex can be inside the square or out. Either way, an intersection of edges occur. Thus, $K_5$ is not planar.

Euler's formula

$$
V-E+F=2
$$

can be applied to planar graphs. A proof can be derived using induction.
