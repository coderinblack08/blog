# Introduction

The goal of this article is to serve as a simple guide to the binary search algorithm and a place to reference it's implementations.

Binary search is a search algorithm that works by comparing the value of the middle element of the array to the target value. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the left side of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues on the right side of the array.

By cutting the search space in half on every single operation, the time complexity for this algorithm is `O(log(n))` given the array is sorted.

# Binary search on a sorted array

# Binary search on monotonic functions
