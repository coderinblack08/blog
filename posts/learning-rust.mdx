Sorry about not posting in a while! For the past week, I've been trying out Elixir. The syntax is great, but I really didn't think it was something I would enjoy use. I love tinkering with new languages/frameworks so I started learning Rust today (yes today, today)! Here's where I'm at so far:

- Learned Cargo & Stuff
- Variables and Mutability
- Functions
- For, Loop, & While
- If-else, match, etc.
- Stack, Heap, Scope, & Ownership/Borrowing/References

Rust is super interesting because of its low-level system language abilities and its modern syntax. It makes sure you are being safe with memory and defaults variables and references to be immutable. Like Elixir, Rust doesn't have a return keyword and has the `1..4` syntax to create a range (I love it).

Allocation on the heap in Rust is different then C++...but in a good way.
For example, if we wanted to allocate a dynamic `String`, we could easily do the following.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("Hello");
  mutate(&mut s);
  println!("{}", s);
} // s automatically gets destroyed after its scope "ends"!

fn mutate(s: &mut String) {
  s.push_str(" World!");
}
```

Rust automatically destroys the allocated memory based on scope. Rust makes us super duper safe by making sure we don't combine both a mutable and immutable reference together, create two mutable references, and etc.

Overall, I'm super pumped about Rust and am planing on using it in my backend (possibly with Actix Web, mainly because I want to see that speed üöÄ)! Anyways, I've leave more updates soon. **Peace ‚úåÔ∏è**.
